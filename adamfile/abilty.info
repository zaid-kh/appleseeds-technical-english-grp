Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are 
designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More 
specifically, people can:

perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
contribute to the Web
Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the 
Web, including:

-auditory
-cognitive
-neurological
-physical
-speech
-visual

*Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

-people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices 
 with small screens, different input modes, etc.
-older people with changing abilities due to ageing
-people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses
-people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an 
 environment where they cannot listen to audio
-people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive 
 bandwidth

this is an example how we can sempelize and make it more Semantic  input using a button element insted 
of div , that will make it easiar way to enter and acces for people with 
disabilty : 

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
<p>Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct 
purpose as much as possible.</p>
<p>If you need a button, use the button element and not a div element:</p>

<button>Report an Error</button>

<div>Report an Error</div>

<p>A button element has more suitable styling than a div, and it is 
clickable by default.</p>

</body>
</html>
