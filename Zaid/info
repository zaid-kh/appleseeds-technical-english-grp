WCAG or Web Accessability Guidlines are the set of guidlines curated by the W3 consortium to help people with disabilities browse the web as smooth as possible -when these guidlines are followed-.

WCAG covers web sites, applications, and other digital content.

There are three levels of conformance:

	*Level A is the minimum level.
	*Level AA includes all Level A and AA requirements. Many organizations strive to meet Level AA.
	*Level AAA includes all Level A, AA, and AAA requirements.

Main principles of WCAG include the following: 
1) Perceivable
	Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
For example: a person who is visually impaired has an interface that has text that describes images, which in turn can be listened to as voice.

2) Operable
	Visitors should be able to navigate through your website without any limitations around functionality or time.

Example: requirement: Logical focus order (A)	
	The "tabbing order" of focusable page features (e.g. links, buttons, form inputs) makes logical sense, meaning that the page is still usable by non-sighted/keyboard users.

3) Understandable
	Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.


4) Robust
	Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
